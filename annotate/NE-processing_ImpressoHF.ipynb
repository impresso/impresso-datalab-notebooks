    "## What is this notebook about?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Impresso models for named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking (EL).\n",
    "\n",
    "NER detects and classifies entities such as persons, locations, and organizations in text, while EL connects recognized entities to unique identifiers in a knowledge base, like Wikipedia or its data counterpart, Wikidata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, both NER and EL are performed using models trained by Impresso and hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/impresso-project/) (thus the 'HF' suffix in the notebook name):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Impresso NER model** is a Transformer model trained on the Impresso HIPE-2020 portion of the [HIPE-2022 dataset](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data). It recognizes entity types such as person, location, and organization while supporting the complete [HIPE typology](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/documentation/README-hipe2020.md), including coarse and fine-grained entity types as well as components like names, titles, and roles. Additionally, the NER model's backbone ([dbmdz/bert-medium-historic-multilingual-cased](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-medium-historic-multilingual-cased)) was trained on various European historical datasets, giving it a broader language capability.  This training included data from the Europeana and British Library collections across multiple languages: German, French, English, Finnish, and Swedish. Due to this multilingual backbone, the NER model may also recognize entities in other languages beyond French and German.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The **Impresso NEL model** links detected entities to unique identifiers in Wikipedia and Wikidata or assigns a 'NIL' label (indicating \"not in list\" in NLP) if no reference is found. The NEL model was trained on various historical datasets (AjMC, CLEF-HIPE-2020, LeTemps, Living with Machines, NewsEye, SoNAR) across multiple languages, including German, French, English, Finnish, and Swedish, to support comprehensive entity linking (EL) and named entity recognition (NER). Its backbone, [mGENRE,](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mgenre-wiki) uses a multilingual text generation approach for Wikipedia entity prediction, trained on 105 languages from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models can also be tested interactively in Hugging Face spaces: the [NER space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impresso-project/multilingual-named-entity-recognition) and the [EL space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impresso-project/multilingual-entity-linking).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will you learn in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will know how to:\n",
    "- Install the necessary libraries to run the models\n",
    "- Load the models and modules from Hugging Face\n",
    "- Perform NER on a text input\n",
    "- Perform EL on the NER output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**:\n",
    "To use this notebook, you may need to set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable in the `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`). You can obtain a token by signing up on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/join) and find additional information in the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.2/en/quick-start#environment-variable). If you do not want to register an account on HF, simply select Cancel when prompted for a Hugging Face token — no token is needed for this notebook."

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "First, we install and download necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **torch**: PyTorch is a popular open-source library for deep learning that provides tools for tensor computation, GPU acceleration, and building neural networks.\n",
    "- **protobuf**: Protobuf, short for 'Protocol Buffers', is a library developed by Google for serializing structured data in a fast and efficient way, ideal for communication between services. \n",
    "- **sentencepiece**: SentencePiece is a text processing library used primarily for tokenization, especially for languages with complex scripts. It supports subword tokenization, which is key for training language models that need flexible token units (e.g., parts of words). BERT and transformers in general often use SentencePiece for multilingual support.\n",
    "- **transformers**:  Developed by Hugging Face, this library offers many functionalities to support the development of NLP deep learning models. It provides pre-trained models for various tasks, supports architectures like BERT, GPT, T5, and others for model developement and manipulation, offers useful pipelines and easily integrates with PyTorch. The models developed by Impresso are BERT-based-\n",
    "**nltk**: The Natural Language Toolkit is a library for NLP in Python that offers tools for text processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and parsing, as well as datasets for linguistic research and training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries can be installed from the notebook, or within your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install torch protobuf sentencepiece transformers nltk\n",
    "```"

    "Are the previously recognised entities present in the Impresso Corpus? For each entity, we use impresso_session.entities.find() to look it up by name. This search will attempt to find a match for the exact name provided. If OCR errors are introduced (e.g., \"Max1milien Robespierre\" instead of \"Maximilien Robespierre\"), we can observe how resilient the search function is to variations. Let's explore using the Impresso API and Python Library. "
