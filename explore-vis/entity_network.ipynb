    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you step-by-step through how to create netowrk graphs that represent peoples connections in historical newspapers. We define people's connections based on whether they occur in the same content item.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Impresso, a **Content Item** is the smallest unit of editorial content within a newspaper or radio collection. This can be an article (for newspapers) or a radio show or episode (for radio programs). Content items can also vary by type, including articles, advertisements, tables, images, and more. Please note that when a newspaper does not have segmentation (OLR) content items for this title correspond to pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notebook, you can produce a representation of the media narratives by looking at how people have been associated to others by the press. Interpreting this association, however, can be tricky. It doesn't mean necessarily that those people have had any type of relationship. It just means that their names have been mentioned in, for example, the same news article. To unveil the reasons why they occur together, further analysis using different methods is necessary. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided you with a comprehensive pipeline to create network graphs using the Impresso corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to have in mind that only persons who have been tagged as entity 'persons' in the Impresso corpus will be added to this graph. Because of the way Named Entity Recognition (NER) works, it is possible that some people that are mentioned in the texts are not recognised as 'person' by the algorithms. In this case, those people will not be shown in the graph. For more information on NER, check our [FAQ](https://impresso-project.ch/app/faq#what-is-nep).\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for now! Next, you can explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the [Visualising Place Entities on Maps](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/blob/main/annotate/NE-processing_ImpressoAPI.ipynb) notebook, which demonstrates how to visualise in a map mentions to places in the Impresso corpus.\n",
    "- the [Named Entity Recognition with impresso-pipelines]() notebook, which allows you reuse Impresso NER models and apply them to your own data. "
