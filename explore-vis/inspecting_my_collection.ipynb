        "This notebook provides you with basic tools for a data-driven inspection of your collection using data visualisation tools. By plotting several charts, it should facilitate the identification of the nature of the content you have stored in your collection, helping with analysing your corpus or even planning ammendments to the content you collected.  Moreover, this notebook aims at fostering data/source criticism by raising awareness on the origing of Impresso metadata and quality of digitised materials.    \n",
