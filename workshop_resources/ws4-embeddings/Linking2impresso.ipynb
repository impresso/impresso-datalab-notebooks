        "## What is this notebook about?\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to link an external collection of texts (and optionally images) to the Impresso historical media archive using semantic embeddings.  \n",
        "It walks through preparing a small example dataset, generating embeddings, querying the\n",
        "Impresso API for similar items, and visualising the results in interactive semantic\n",
        "graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is this useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantic linking helps researchers contextualise their own materials within a large historical corpus. By comparing your texts with Impresso documents, you can identify related themes, trace conceptual connections, and explore the broader historical discourse.  \n",
        "This notebook shows how embedding-based search offers an efficient way to connect local\n",
        "datasets to digital archives.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How does it work?\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow is straightforward:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prepare or upload your text collection.\n",
        "2. Generate embeddings with the Impresso embedding model.\n",
        "3. Query the Impresso API using vector-based similarity search.\n",
        "4. Visualize input texts and retrieved items using discrete and similarity graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impresso stores text and image embeddings in a compact Base64-encoded format.  \n",
        "For local similarity computations, these embeddings must be decoded into numeric vectors.  \n",
        "The notebook provides helper functions to convert between Impresso’s internal format and standard floating-point vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both text and image embeddings follow the same principle but rely on different\n",
        "underlying models.\n",
