        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to explore historical image collections using Impresso’s text-to-image and image-only embeddings, from keyword search to visual similarity retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **first section**, we begin with Open-CLIP to perform text-to-image search: starting from keyphrases, we retrieve relevant images, then embed those same keywords to compare them directly with image embeddings, and finally refine the queries to explore more nuanced results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **second section**, we work with DinoV2 image-only embeddings to identify visual similarities within the collection. Given a single reference image, we search for visually related items and interpret what features the model captures.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will explore **how radio is represented both in images, and in the programs**. This will allow us to explore the image and textual elements using both types of embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What you will learn?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Perform keyword-based image retrieval using image captions and Open-CLIP, and convert a text query into an embedding for text-to-image similarity search;\n",
        "- Use DINOv2 to search for visual similarities directly from a reference image;\n",
        "- Compare how multimodal embeddings and visual-only embeddings support different research strategies.\n",
